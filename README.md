# shiny_evolution
Demonstration code to illustrate the evolution in complexity as a shiny app grows organically.

# Evolution

The aim of this project is to create an app that allows users to upload some data, plot some variables and export the plot.  It is/will be broken down into specific tags that demonstrate the addition of key features.  

1. User can choose columns from the airquality dataset and plot these as a scatter plot
2. User can choose different datasets and variable selection dynamically changes
    a. Finite dataset options available via a dropdown
    b. File upload option
3. Combine with ggTag and plot option to enable meta info to be added
4. Add evaluation code to create reproducible R script

# Running the app

To run the app simple source the app.R file.
